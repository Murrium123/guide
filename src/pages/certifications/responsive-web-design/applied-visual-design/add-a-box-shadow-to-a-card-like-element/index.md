## Add a box-shadow to a Card-like Element

Hi Everyone! I was having trouble with this page so I am sharing how it gets done. When you add ids you add them with a hash:tag or pound key (#). 
So I kept writing the code like this:
.thumbnail{
box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
}
but I was supposed to write it like this :
#thumbnail{
box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
}

I hope that helps!
